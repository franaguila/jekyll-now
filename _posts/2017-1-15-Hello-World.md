title: Kanekta was born!
---

I met Pri and Sheen in a university club. Not the kind of school club that had wannabe DJs and an endless sea of drunken people, but a club where a group of students planned events and conferences. We were all had similar career goals, to start a social enterprise, but only if society allowed it. That is, so long as it we could afford to feed ourselves--at least eventually.

After undergrad, I decided to take a trip to Madrid and Paris, and by happy coincidence Sheen and Pri were there on a university global exchange program. So I (naturally) said yes to free lodging. It was a great trip (save for Paris attacks) and we grew close in a way where the university club experience just fell short.

The following summer, Sheen asked us to join her in this poorly run competition. And during that competition, Kanekta was materialized from logo sketches on Pri's notebooks to a business plan, pro forma financial statements, and the same familiar team.
